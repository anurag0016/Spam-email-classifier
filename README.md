# Spam-email-classifier
Developed a supervised machine learning model to accurately classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham). The project involved preprocessing a labeled dataset of emails, transforming textual data using TF-IDF vectorization, and training classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes. Achieved high accuracy and F1-score by optimizing feature extraction and model parameters. This system demonstrates a practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in filtering unwanted content in real-time communication systems.

Key Highlights:

Used TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for feature engineering

Applied Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification

Achieved over 95% accuracy on test data

Visualized performance using confusion matrix and classification report
